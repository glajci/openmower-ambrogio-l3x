> [!NOTE]
> You will find similar project in [openmower-display](https://github.com/glajci/openmower-display/blob/main/README.md) repository.

#### Features

* Show actual OpenMower state, sensors values (GPS accuracy, Battery voltage, Charging)
* Start, Pause, Dock, Reset Emergency, Skip area, Skip path actions
* Sleep timer turns off display after 60s, wakes on any button press

#### Tools

You will need:

* A [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-w-your-6-iot-platform/).
* A micro SD Card (at least 8GB)
* A micro USB to Ethernet adapter.
* A 16x2 lcd i2c display.
* A micro-USB cable and Ethernet cable.
* A source code files (included in this repository)
* A computer (presumably, the one you are reading this on!)

Additionally, if your Zero W does not have any GPIO headers pre-attached, you will need:

* A pair of Zero GPIO header pins.
* A soldering iron + solder.
* A breadboard to align the pins while soldering.

##### Setup

Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite (no desktop) to the SD Card using [RPi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software)
> [!NOTE]
> Do not forget to configure: hostname, login, password, wifi SSID, wifi password and enable SSH to get access to Pi Zero W later on.

Insert micro SD card to Pi Zero W and power it on. Wait until it starts.

> [!NOTE]
> All examples below are for Windows OS and for user omdisplay and password omdisplay. Please change it accordingly to your setup.

Edit [config.py](pico_zero_w/display/src/config.py) file and set the IP of the Openmower's Rpi Ehternet device.
example
```
mqtt_host = "172.16.78.1"
mqtt_port = 1883
```
> [!NOTE]
> To determine the IP of the Openmower's Rpi Ehternet device, SSH to Openmower Rpi and execute ip addr show eth0

Copy all python (*.py) files from [pico_zero_w/display/src](pico_zero_w/display/src) to Pi Zero W.
example
```
pscp -r -pw omdisplay {your_location}\pico_zero_w\display\src\*.* omdisplay@omdisplay.local:/home/omdisplay
```

SSH to Pi Zero W
example
```
putty -ssh omdisplay.local:22 -l omdisplay -pw omdisplay  
```

Make main.py file executable
```
chmod +x /home/omdisplay/main.py
```

Create new systemd service file
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/omdisplay.service
```

Paste the following content
```
[Unit]
Description=My Python Startup Script
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/omdisplay/main.py
WorkingDirectory=/home/omdisplay
StandardOutput=inherit
StandardError=inherit
Restart=always
User=pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable omdisplay.service
sudo systemctl start omdisplay.service
```

The application will now auto-start whenever you supply power to your Pi Zero W.

To check status
```
systemctl status omdisplay.service
```

To see the logs
```
journalctl -u omdisplay.service -f
```


### The display - Variant 2 - Raspberry Pico W

Display connects to the OpenMower's MQTT over WIFI (either via router or directly to OpenMower's Hotspot), to both, read and send MQTT messages.

> [!NOTE]
> You will find similar project in [openmower-display](https://github.com/glajci/openmower-display/blob/main/README.md) repository.

#### Features

* Show actual OpenMower state, sensors values (GPS accuracy, Battery voltage, Charging)
* Start, Pause, Dock, Reset Emergency, Skip area, Skip path actions
* Sleep timer turns off display after 60s, wakes on any button press

#### Tools

You will need:

* A [Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-w-your-6-iot-platform/).
* A 16x2 lcd i2c display.
* A micro-USB cable.
* A UF2 image (included in this repository) for Pico W.
* A computer (presumably, the one you are reading this on!)
* [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).

Additionally, if your Pico W does not have any GPIO headers pre-attached, you will need:

* A pair of Pico GPIO header pins.
* A soldering iron + solder.
* A breadboard to align the pins while soldering.

##### Setup

While holding down the BOOTSEL button on your Pico, connect it to your device via micro-USB cable.

The Pico should present itself as a USB mass storage drive.

Copy the [UF2](display/RPI_PICO_W-20241129-v1.24.1.uf2) file to the root of the drive. Once copied, the storage drive will automatically disconnect, and the Pico is ready for use.

##### Basic Config

There are 2 possible configurations of the display:
1. connecting the display to the same WIFI, the OpenMower is connected
2. connecting the display to the OpenMower's Hotspot (possible if you are using external WIFI USB dongle plugged in the OpenMower's Raspberry Pi with [this](/readme/hotspot.txt.settings) CommitUp configuration of the OpenMower (primary_wifi_device: wlan0)
 * Personally I prefer the option 2, as you will avoid WIFI range issues (Rpi Pico W does not have the external WIFI antenna connector). Connecting the display to the RPi HotSpot will ensure the stable connection. Option 1 will work as well if you have a good WIFI coverage over the mowing areas or if you intend to use it as a Remote Control.
   
Open the following files in the text editor of your choice: `config.py` and `secrets.py`.

In `secrets.py`, you need to provide:

* The SSID and password for your WiFi network or OpenMower Hotspot (prefferable).

Example:
```bash
ssid = "openmower-93"
password = "openmower"
```

In `config.py`, you need to provide:

* The IP address or hostname (openmower.local) of MQTT of the OpenMower, and the MQTT port

Example:
```bash
mqtt_host = "10.41.0.1"
mqtt_port = 1883
```

##### First Run

Once the above steps are complete, connect your Pico W to your machine and open Thonny. Make sure to select the Pico's MicroPython environment on the bottom-right of the Thonny window, then, once connected, upload each of the `.py` files to your device.

**NOTE:** Depending on the UF2 image that you used, you *might* need to install the `urequests` package before running the display for the first time. To do this, uncomment the relavent lines in `mqtt.py`, save to the Pico and then run `main.py` once manually in order for the Pico to connect to your network and install the package. Alternatively, you can install `urequests` to the Pico via Thonny's package manager.

Once installed, stop execution, re-comment or delete the lines, save and re-upload to the Pico.

The application will now auto-start whenever you supply power to your Pico.





After successful installation you should see something like that:

![Main screen](readme/IMG_7932.JPG?)

Turn on the OpenMower, it will try to establish MQTT connection.

![Demo picture](readme/IMG_7977.JPG?)

When the connection is established you should be able to operate the OpenMower:

![Demo picture](readme/IMG_7930.JPG?)

Pressing the Up, Down or Enter button on the top cover panel, you will enter the menu.
Depending on the current mower status you will see one of the submenus.

![](readme/IMG_7935.JPG?)
![](readme/IMG_7987.JPG?)
![](readme/IMG_7988.JPG?)


Using Up and Down arrows on the top cover panel, you can scroll the available submenus.
Pressing Enter will execute the selected menu action (example: Reset Emergency) and return to main view.

When OpenMower operates you will see one of the following statuses.
